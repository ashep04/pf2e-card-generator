# Usage
Fill out the forms as needed for whether it's a spell, feat, item, etc. Any unfilled forms will be hidden when printing the page. You can press the plus button near "Name" to add more traits as needed. You can add more heightened effects by pressing the plus button at the bottom of the card.
# Printing
1. Press `ctrl + p` after filling out all your forms
2. Select your destination (*pdf recommended*)
3. Set orientation to landscape
4. Set color more to color
5. Set scale to 100%
6. Set margins to none
7. Disabled "Print headers and footers"
8. Enable "Print backgrounds"
9. Print!
# Notes
- You can always press `ctrl + p` to view how the page would look before saving. Closing the print menu won't mess with your progress.
- Be careful when deleting all text from a box as most will become too small to then select again. You can press `ctrl + z` on some browsers to undo your last input which should reset it to empty again if applicable.
- **Refreshing the page will remove all progress!** Make sure to only do this if you mean to.
- Sometimes the scaling will be slightly off on cards so you may see some text be hidden at the bottom. If that happens generally adding two spacing of new lines in a text box that is visible will fix it.
- If both the heightened level and effect are not filled out then the entire line won't show.
- If you add to many traits you'll have to manually go through and delete the span in the html. Hint: `F12`. You can also just refresh the page to remove them. 
# To-do
- Hide traits if they are empty.
- Hide trait bar if all traits present are empty.
- Fix the scaling bug where the font will clip sometimes when it gets long.
- Prevent span from becomming unclickable when you add text then remove it all.
